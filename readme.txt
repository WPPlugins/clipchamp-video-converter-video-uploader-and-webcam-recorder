Collect videos and webcam recordings from your site's visitors. 
Receive videos directly into your Cloud storage or the WP Media Gallery.

== Description ==

Collect videos and let users record webcam clips directly on your site. Simply add the short code [clipchamp] to any of your WordPress posts or pages, which embeds a recorder and video upload button wherever you like. You can embed more than 1 button in the same post and select from a range of upload targets that videos get submitted to.

Our HTML5 camera is based on the Clipchamp [video API](https://clipchamp.com/en/api), bringing modern video recording, client-side transcoding and uploading to WordPress in one package - no Flash, no WebRTC. Trial it for free for 14 days, no credit card required. At the end of the trial period, there are 4 plans to choose from, depending on the features you'd like to use in your specific scenario and your expected video volume per month. Plans start at $9/month and you can upgrade, downgrade or cancel at any time. [Please see here](https://clipchamp.com/en/pricing/api-access) for an overview of all plans and features.

Unlike other webcam recorders or video uploaders, Clipchamp is entirely HTML5 & JavaScript, using the cutting-edge of modern web technologies. Its client-side transcoding component reduces or even eliminates the need for server-side transcoding and involved costs - you receive video files that are streaming-ready and in a standard format. 

Clipchamp is unique insofar as it compresses and converts user-generated videos on the user device into one of the supported video formats (MP4, WebM, ASF, FLV) before files get uploadd to you. The videos your users record get submitted directly from their devices to an upload target you choose without any detours through our servers for better privacy protection - we [never have access](https://help.clipchamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/215476938-Does-Clipchamp-have-access-to-my-users-videos-) to your users' videos.

Our video recorder is in use on websites and in web apps across a broad range of industries such as education, online casting, recruiting, real estate, market research or sports video analysis. It's also a popular video tool for web design agencies for client projects. Any questions or things you'd like to clarify? Send us a message at info(at)clipchamp.com and one of us will be in touch right away. Until then, greetings from Brisbane and happy recording :-)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What can I do with the Clipchamp Video Uploader and Webcam Recorder plugin? =

This plugin lets you collect user generated videos. It embeds a button on your WordPress-based website that your visitors can click to either 1) record videos and upload to you or 2) upload video files they already have on their device. The plugin comes with a number of resolution (incl. 480p, 720p, 1080p), format (incl. MP4 and WebM) and compression (5 levels) options.

= How is it different from a plain file uploader? =

Your users' video files get compressed & converted on the client before they get uploaded to you. As a result, you'll get much smaller files in 1 standard format of your choice (MP4, WebM, FLV,...). This dramatically reduces or even eliminates the huge costs involved in server-side video transcoding.

= Do my users' videos go through Clipchamp servers? =

No, all videos your users create get processed on your website visitors' devices and uploaded from there straight to you. Clipchamp never sees or touches the files, you're in full control. Your users can thus safely submit any type of video to you - such as interview pitches, auditions, competition entries, feedback or educational videos.

= Is the Clipchamp technology purely based on HTML5? =

Yes, your users do not require Flash or other technologies for Clipchamp to work on their devices when visiting your website. The plugin uses HTML5 and JavaScript.

= Does this plugin work on mobile devices? =

Yes, it works across desktop and mobile versions of your website or web app and your users can create and upload videos on desktop and mobile devices. Content they create gets uploaded to your cloud storage.

= Is it free? =

You can trial the plugin and all its features for free for 14 days, no credit card required. At the end of the trial period, there are 4 plans to choose from, depending on the features you'd like to use in your specific scenario and your expected video volume per month. Plans start at $9/month and you can upgrade, downgrade or cancel at any time. [Please see here](https://clipchamp.com/en/pricing/api-access) for an overview of all plans and features.
